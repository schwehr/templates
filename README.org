#+STARTUP: showall

* Introduction

This is my project to capture language template files that I use as
documentation and sample code for basic tasks.  I'm also going to try
to rewrite my dot files in a mixed public/private mode where I've
split off the material that I can't give out.  It has a different feel
to me than yasnippets for these templates, but I will also try to
build snippet libraries that I can use.
